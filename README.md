The Covid-19 pandemic has been hitting hard on much American business. In response to it, the US government has initiated the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) in order to help businesses continue paying their workers. 

In this project, I will use public data to get insights into this program. The data for all states is available here

As an Illinois resident, I will restrict myself to Illinois only. 

I first learned about the PPP program from a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/PyDataChi/events/271789356"> talk</a> by Rory Hartong-Redden. He  had a <a href="https://github.com/roryhr/data_science_generalist"> Github repo </a> for his talk where he also did some analysis. My approach is a little different from Rory's: I will focus more on visualization. 

I am thankful to the Data Science Generalist team for organizing this event and to Rory for his wonderful talk.
